# TITLE  :-  WINE QUALITY


# DESCRIPTION  :- 


Two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal.
The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.
Wine can be classified by human experts or by physicochemical laboratory tests – pH or alcohol values or density determination.


# Input variables (based on physicochemical tests) :


1 - fixed acidity : Fixed acidity is measured as total acidity minus volatile acidity.

2 - volatile acidity : Volatile acidity is a measure of the wine's volatile (or gaseous) acids. The primary volatile acid in wine is acetic acid

3 - citric acid : Citric acid is a weak organic acid, which is often used as a natural preservative

4 - residual sugar :

5 - chlorides : The amount of salt in the wine

6 - free sulfur dioxide : Free SO2 is important for determining preservation ability.

7 - total sulfur dioxide : It is a chemical compound used by winemakers to help keep their wine protected from the negative effects of oxygen exposure as well as spoilage microorganisms.

8 - density : Density is the mass per unit volume of wine or must at 20°C.

9 - pH : pH is a measure of the acidity of wine. All wines ideally have a pH level between 2.9 and 4.2. The lower the pH, the more acidic the wine is, the higher the pH, the less acidic the wine.

10 - sulphates : To protect and preserve the wine's character, flavor, and color.

11 - alcohol :


# Output variable (based on sensory data) :


12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)



#  CONCLUSION :-


Four classification methods were used to evaluate the accuracy of each model in predicting classes of wine.

Logistic Regression Gives better performance of model i.e it gives accuracy of about 88%.
